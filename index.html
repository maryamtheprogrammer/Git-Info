        <p>Git is a <mark>DevOps tool used for source code management.</mark> It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. </p>

    <h2>Is Git a language or software?</h2>
    <p>Git is <mark>free and open source software</mark> shared under the GPL-2.0-only license. Since its creation, Git has become the most popular distributed version control system, with nearly 95% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022.</p>
